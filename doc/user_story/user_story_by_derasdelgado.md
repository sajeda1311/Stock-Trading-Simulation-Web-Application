## Admin users that can create games

* As an admin, I'd like a way to test players on their skills as stock investors.
* A good proxy to measure this could be a game simulation in which players compete against each other to see who's the best stock investor.
* As an admin, there should be a section in my dashboard that allows me to create games for players, with some ruleset assigned.
* These portfolios created for the selected player(s) should be custom-tailored, and reflect some realistic scenarios (eg. starting with a small amount of cash for beginners or a large amount for seasoned investors, and limited by time)
* As an admin, I want to monitor the players portfolios' performance while the game is running.
