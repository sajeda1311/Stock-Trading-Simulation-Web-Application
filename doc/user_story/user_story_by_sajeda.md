### User Story by Sajedabanu Patel  
**Feature**: Allow players to buy and sell actions at the current NYSE prices  

**As a** registered player,  
**I want to** execute buy and sell transactions at real-time NYSE stock prices,  
**so that** I can make strategic trading decisions to maximize the value of my portfolio during the game.

### Acceptance Criteria  
1. Players must be authenticated to perform transactions.  
2. The system retrieves the latest NYSE stock prices and displays them before any action.  
3. A transaction is allowed only if:
   - Sufficient funds are available (for buying).
   - Owned stock quantity is adequate (for selling).  
4. The portfolio and cash balance update immediately upon successful transaction completion.  
5. Players receive error notifications if conditions (e.g., insufficient funds/stocks) are not met.

This user story follows the recommended format:  
- It specifies the **user role** (registered player).  
- Clearly defines the **objective** (executing transactions).  
- States the **value** (maximize portfolio value).  

By adhering to this structure, the story focuses on user needs, aligns with Agile principles, and ensures implementation details are separate from user goals.
