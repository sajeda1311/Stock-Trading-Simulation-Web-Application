## Project Details

### Summary
The stock trading simulation project is a web application where players compete in a simulated trading environment using real-time NYSE prices. Players aim to maximize their portfolioâ€™s value by the end of the simulation. Admins manage games, configure settings, and monitor player activities through an admin dashboard.

### Relevant Features for Sprint 3

- **Existing Feature**: Improve GUI
- **New Feature**: Graphical display of portfolio performance over the simulation
- **Bug Fix**: Google reCAPTCHA design glitch
- **Sub Feature**: Design "Create Game" page

### Assigned PR Details

- **PR URL**: [#138](https://github.com/CS6905F24/term-project-teamh/pull/138)
- **PR Title**: Sajeda: Implemented existing feature "Improve GUI," designed 'Create a Game' page, and completed new assigned feature
- **PR Description Highlights**:
  - Features were implemented using dummy data due to a 404 error on the API.
  - GUI and features tested internally during team meetings.
  - Followed code review process during internal meetings.
  - Future improvement plans include real-time data integration.

## Code Review Guidelines

### Review Scope
1. **Functionality**:
   - Ensure the feature works as intended (e.g., GUI displays correctly, dummy data integration is functional).
   - Verify that the implementation matches the PR description and assigned task.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Check for clean, readable, and well-commented code.
   - Ensure adherence to project coding standards.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Confirm appropriate handling of edge cases.
   - Validate fallback mechanisms for unavailable API data.

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Verify testing for the newly added features.
   - Confirm existing functionalities are unaffected.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Ensure alignment with the design specifications.
   - Confirm GUI responsiveness and usability across devices.

6. **Collaboration**:
   - Validate PR integration with the Kanban board tasks.
   - Check for clear and actionable documentation in the PR.

### Code Review Workflow
1. **Preparation**:
   - Read the PR description thoroughly.
   - Familiarize yourself with the assigned tasks and context.

2. **Review Process**:
   - Pull the branch locally and test the feature.
   - Review changes line-by-line in the code for quality, logic, and style.
   - Use the Kanban board tasks to cross-check completion of requirements.

3. **Feedback**:
   - Provide constructive feedback through GitHub comments.
   - Highlight code improvements, errors, or deviations from standards.
   - Suggest actionable changes or enhancements if needed.

4. **Approval**:
   - Approve the PR only if all requirements are met.
   - Confirm with the team during meetings before merging.

### PR-specific Notes
For PR #138:
- Dummy data implementation for testing was necessary due to API limitations.
- Ensure GUI improvements and the "Create Game" page design meet functional requirements.
- Confirm team-approved fixes and tests were implemented as discussed during meetings.
