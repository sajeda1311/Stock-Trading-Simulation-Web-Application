# Team member's performance review (Sprint3)

## sajeda
Overall: She greatly participates in team discussions and meetings, did her tasks on time, but was hindered by our development at the start.
* Time management: She completed all of her tasks, at the beginning there were few for her as we had a slow start developing the sprint 3 parts.
* Communication: She participates a lot in the team discussions and meetings, to the point of being a leader as a PM.
* Collaboration: She completed her work in time.
* Resourcefulness: She reminds us whenever we are slowing things down in the team chat. She also lists all pending tasks.

## vthummar
Overall: I have seen some improvements on the usage of the proper tools to report issues. He came up with a nice feature to have in the project.
* Time management:.
* Communication: Some of the issues he faces can be put on the Issue tracker. Compared to last sprint, he is using more the issue tracker.
* Collaboration: His work mostly fits into the architecture diagram.
* Resourcefulness: He came up with a new feature for the project.

## saabbas
Overall: He has improved his communications skills, still needs to show his work more often.
* Time management: He participated in all team meetings, he creates his work on time.
* Communication: Compared to last sprint, I see some improvements. He communicates more about his tasks on the team chat and explains what he's doing to other team members, but then he doesn't mention updates on his tasks, this can be improved.
* Collaboration: He participates more on team discussions, and he has actively discussed changes and features more (compared to last sprint).
* Resourcefulness: It would be great if he could inform more on his updates.


# Team member's performance review (Sprint 2)

## sajeda
Overall: She participates in every discussion, team meeting and Kanban board issue. She always reminds us to use the Kanban board for our tasks.
* Time management: There were some days in the middle of the sprint where there were less updates on the project workflow.
* Communication: She's always ready to reply for any question or issue that arises on the Kanban board.
* Collaboration: She helped us to manage the initial prototyping for the project structure, and look-and-feel of pages. She did her part accordingly.
* Resourcefulness: She has ample experience working with the front-end parts of the application. She could benefit more and our team by gaining some more insight to help the backend of the project.

## vthummar
Overall: Needs to improve on the usage of the proper tools to report issues. His work mostly uses what was described in the architecture file, with little changes, that need to be stated.
* Time management: There were some days in the middle of the sprint where there were less updates on the project workflow.
* Communication: He always have questions regarding the process and workflow, while this is excellent, he should make them in the issue tracker or meetings instead of Whatsapp.
* Collaboration: The product mostly fits into the project specs, there are some small details not following the architecture (but this changed later on).
* Resourcefulness: He properly uses the issue tracker to help other team members.

## saabbas
Overall: He needs to be more communicative for us to understand what is he working on and how his work impacts the overall project.
* Time management: There were some days in the middle of the sprint where there were less updates on the project workflow.
* Communication: I think he should improve in this area, most of the time there are no updates nor questions, so I don't know if everything's going alright or not.
* Collaboration: He completed most of this tasks on the time allowed, but because of the last point, we didn't know much of it up until the end. Most of his work forced the most architecture changes.
* Resourcefulness: He should ask more questions on the issue tracker.
